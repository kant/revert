### Webhooks

#### How to handle connection webhooks

To verify that the request is being made from us (and not an impersonator) you can add the following verification step in your request handlers.

```js
Example for Express (Javascript)
// This is the secret returned in the response when creating a webhook.
const secret = <UNIQUE*SECRET_FOR_ENDPOINT>
const payload = req.body;
const headers = req.headers;
const signedContent = ${headers['svix-id']}.${headers['svix-timestamp']}.${JSON.stringify(payload)};
const secretBytes = Buffer.from(secret?.split('*')[1], 'base64');
const signature = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secretBytes).update(signedContent).digest('base64');
const verified = (headers['svix-signature'] as any).split(' ')
.map((x: string) => x.split(',')[1])
.includes(signature);
// Use the verified to boolean to continue processing the webhook is true.
```

We use our friends at [Svix](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/how-manual) for sending you webhooks, this piece of code verifies that we are the senders.
